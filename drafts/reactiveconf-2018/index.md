## Reactive Conf 2018

There were two stages with paralell talks. In addition to the main stage, there was also Discovery Stage, which was focused on not only on presentations, but also on Ask Me Anything sessions with many of the speakers. This was a nice opportuinity to ask questions, which in many cases in my opinion was even more interesting than the original talks. The questions were managed by [sli.do](https://www.sli.do/) - everyone could submit a question. Then everybody could vote for their favorite one. Questions with the most votes were then asked.

## Day 1
The beginning of the conference was the busiest period for u volunteers. We had to register more than 1000 visitors. I spent most of the time providing various goodies to the attendees in exchange for their "Reactive Gift" vouchers.

After the talks finished there was still a lot more to do. You could stay for a "Discover Czech" event, which was basically a party with selection of classic Czech delicacies such as nakládaný hermelín (pickled cheese), utopenec (pickled sausages), various czech pies or traditional plum spirit slivovice. Alternatively, you could join separate parties held by conference's sponsors in their offices - STRV, MEWS, Kiwi or Socialbakers. For those not interested in partying, there was an opportunity to join sightseeing tour of Prague.


## Day 2
My duties changed during the second day, now it was mostly about the Discovery Stage - showing them the way, letting them in and so on. Then some basic cleanup after the conference.

After the talks there was a closing ceremony. Then you could choose from a bunch of "Hangouts" with various companies such as Aragon, HackPrague or Green Fox Academy. Alternatively you could continue in discovering Prague like the day before, which would end with tasting of local wines, beers and spirits.

## Day 3
The last day of the conference was different from the first two days. So called "Festival day" was not at the same venue, instead it was hosted in the Prague Microsoft building. Unlike the first two days, this one was focused mainly on various workshops with limited capacity. It was necessary to register and pay  a fee of 20 € in addition to the conference ticket. There was 14 workshops available in total ranging from 2 to 6 hours. Here is the list:

- Introduction to Elm
- GraphQL with React vs. Angular vs. Vue
- Codelab: Build your first Flutter app
- Introduction to ClojureScript
- Vue.js
- Evolving Patterns in React
- Building type-safe applications with Flow and GraphQL
- Reason DOJO: React and GraphQL
- Reason DOJO: Cross-platform Games in Reprocessing
- Simplify your data processing with BakeryJS
- Introduction to E2E testing with Cypress.io
- Service Workers at Your Service
- How to build cross platform desktop apps with React and Electron
- Vuex like nobody is looking

In addition to workshops, there was one small stage. In the morning, there were just some recorded talks from the previous year. After that there were regular talks for the rest of the days.

My duty for the last day of volunteering was moderating questions from attendees to speakers on sli.do for all the talks of the day. This was probably the best of my assignments as I got to see all the talks and it was interesting and kept me occupied.

After the talks and the final panel discussions with some of the speakers there was an afterparty, still in the Microsoft building.

## Conclusion
I had a great time volunteering at Reactive Conf 2018. It was really interesting to see a conference from the organizer's perspective and a great opportunity to meet many interesting people from all over the world - the organizers, the volunteers and the speakers. I definitely recommend this as an iteresting alternative to just attending a conference.
