With IntelliJ IDEA Edu Tools plugin you can study various programming courses directly in your IDE and work on all the assignments. Alternatively, you can create courses yourself to share with others.

## Getting started
If you already have IntelliJ IDEA installed, all you need to do is to install [EduTools plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-edutools). All you need to do is to go to `File -> Settings -> Plugins -> Marketplace` and search for EduTools. Then just click `Install` and restart your IDE when finished. The plugin is available both for Ultimate and Community edition.

Alternatively, you can download [IntelliJ IDEA EDU](https://www.jetbrains.com/education/download/#section=idea), which is basically the Community Edition bundled with the EduTools plugin. If you are using Python, Jetbrains offer also [Pycharm EDU](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/).
