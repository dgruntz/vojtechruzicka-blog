Let's look at a set of useful tools I use regularly to help me when blogging.

# Grammarly
Since I am not a native english speaker, it is very useful to have a tool to double check my grammar. In additional to wrong grammar, I usually do a lot of typos and there are some words that I just never spell right.

[Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) to the rescue! Before publishing a post I analyze it with Grammarly to make sure it does not contain any typos and bad grammar. Or at least reduce them to minimum.

Grammarly offers a desktop app, which I use for my blog post. In addition, web version is available as well as Microsoft Office integration and a browser extension. So it can check anything you type in your browser such as emails.

The base version is free and should be sufficient in most cases. The paid version offers advanced analysis of the sentence structure, punctuation, plagiarism detector and MS Office integration. For each article you can even define criteria, which help Grammarly to understand the context and tailor its suggestions based on what type of text are you writing.

Currently I use the paid version, which is currently at $11.66 monthly if paid annually.
